Let me help explain semantic search using cricket examples and then break down the math behind it.



Let's understand semantic search through cricket examples:

Traditional (Keyword) Search vs Semantic Search:

Query: "How many runs has Virat scored?"

1. Keyword Search would look for exact matches:
- Only finds documents containing "Virat", "runs", "scored"
- Might miss relevant content using different words like "centuries" or "batting statistics"

2. Semantic Search understands meaning:
- "Virat Kohli has amassed 25,000 international runs across formats"
- "King Kohli recently scored his 50th ODI century"
- "India's batting maestro reached another milestone"

All three sentences are semantically relevant even though they use different words!

Example Paragraphs:

1. "Virat Kohli, often called the modern master of cricket, has revolutionized batting with his aggressive style and fitness standards. His cover drives and ability to chase targets have made him a legend."

2. "Jasprit Bumrah is India's premier fast bowler known for his unique action and yorkers. His ability to take wickets in all conditions makes him special."

3. "Rohit Sharma, nicknamed Hitman, is known for his elegant batting style and ability to hit sixes effortlessly. As captain, he's led India to multiple successes."

How Semantic Search Works (Math Behind It):

1. Text Embedding:
- Convert text into high-dimensional vectors (usually 768 or 1024 dimensions)
- Each word/sentence gets a unique numerical representation
- Example: "Virat" might become [0.2, -0.5, 0.8, ...] in vector space

2. Cosine Similarity:
```
similarity = cos(θ) = (A·B)/(||A||·||B||)
```
where:
- A·B is dot product of vectors
- ||A|| and ||B|| are vector magnitudes
- Result ranges from -1 to 1 (1 being most similar)

3. Vector Space:
- Query: "How many runs has Virat scored?"
- Vector: [0.1, 0.3, -0.2, ...]
- Compares with document vectors
- Finds closest matches based on semantic meaning

4. Transformer Architecture:
- Uses attention mechanisms
- Processes words in context
- BERT, RoBERTa, or similar models encode meaning

Example Calculation:
Let's say we have simplified 3D vectors:
- Query: [0.2, 0.3, 0.1]
- Document 1: [0.25, 0.28, 0.12]
- Document 2: [-0.5, -0.1, 0.8]

Cosine similarity with Document 1 would be higher (≈0.99) than Document 2 (≈0.12), indicating Document 1 is more semantically relevant.

Key Benefits:
1. Understands context and meaning
2. Handles synonyms and related concepts
3. Language-agnostic (works across languages)
4. Better handles natural language queries

This is why semantic search can understand that "Kohli's batting achievements" is relevant to "Virat's runs" even without exact word matches.
